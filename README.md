# Simple Chat App

## Prerequisites

*   **Flutter**: Ensure Flutter is installed and configured on your system.
*   **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed.

## Initialization Steps

### Backend

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Open your terminal in the backend directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

2.  **Start Backend Server**:
    In the same terminal, start the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    Your backend is now running and ready to serve requests.

### Frontend

1.  **Create Flutter Project**:
    If you haven't already, create a new Flutter project by running:
    ```bash
    flutter create frontend
    ```
    Navigate into your newly created `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Replace Project Files**:
    Replace the `lib` folder and the `pubspec.yaml` file in your `frontend` directory with the versions provided in the GitHub repository.

3.  **Run Flutter Application**:
    Ensure your backend is running, then in the `frontend` directory, run the Flutter application:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    This will launch the Gemini Frontend App.
